Add references to Trello work.
I have added all references that I have CERTAINLY used so far. Many of them are duplicated in the article.

From line  531 to 569 are references I had to add, i.e. they where not in the article yet.

The other references below line 539 are duplicated from the article.

Would appreciate if you @diegoavila24 and @dbsdih could take a look at the ones I added and see if everything is ok.
